A tool that makes data sharing between terminal windows easy.

**abra** can be used for displaying info about the current working directory, for splitting stdout and stderr and much more.

Installation
------------

The recommended way to install **abra** is by running: 
```sh
brew install denisidoro/tools/abra
```

If brew isn't available, you can download a pre-compiled binary [here](https://github.com/denisidoro/abra/releases/latest) and extract it to your `$PATH`.

Basic concepts
-----------------
- **abra** is built over Unix sockets
- it can publish and subscribe to channels, manipulating text as necessary
- no terminal multiplexers are necessary

Common use cases
-----------------

### File tree sidebar

Since this is a very common use case, **abra** provides a hook for you. 

If you call the following...

```sh
eval "$(abra hook bash)" # If you use bash, add this to ~/.bashrc
eval "$(abra hook zsh)" # If you use zsh, add this to ~/.zshrc
```

Then you can open a new terminal window and call `abra rx --channel pwd --cmd 'ls {}'`.

Whenever you `cd` into a directory, the sidebar will reflect the changes.

Note: it's suggested to add a shell alias with the command above to save time.

### Split stdout and stderr into different windows

Let's say that you want to run some tests but errors should appear in a different window.

You can use anonymous pipes with **abra** for that purpose:

The commands are:
```sh
abra rx --channel test_out # window 1
abra rx --channel test_err # window 2
cargo test > >(abra tx --channel test_out) 2> >(abra tx --channel test_err) # window 3
```

This is quite verbose, so some aliases can help:

<p>
```sh
rxout() { 
   abra rx --channel "${1}_out"   
}

rxerr() { 
   abra rx --channel "${1}_err"   
}

txspl() { 
   local -r  channel="$1"
   abra rx --channel test_out # window 1
   abra rx --channel test_err # window 2
   "$@" >(abra tx --channel "${channel}_out") 2> >(abra tx --channel "${channel}_err") 
}
```

Then you could call:
```sh
rxout test # window 1
rxerr err # window 2
txspl cargo test # window 3
```

</p>
</details>

### Filter some output lines

Let's say you want to see the contents of a file in a window but show only the lines that contain "foo" in another window:

```sh
abra rx --channel filter --cmd 'echo "{}" | grep foo' # window 1
cat myfile.txt |& tee >(abra tx --channel filter) # window 2
```

Advantages over named pipes
-------------

In theory, you could run the following to achieve similar results:
```sh
mkfifo tmp
tail -f tmp
echo foo > tmp # in another window
```

That said:
- with **abra** you don't need to worry about creating/removing named pipes
- `echo foo > tmp` is blocking in case `tmp` isn't open for reading
   - `abra tx` will terminate immediately if there's no `abra rx` process
- you can have many `abra rx` windows reacting to the same `abra tx` call
- **abra** is cross-platform
   - to correctly create temporary named pipes you need to write platform-specific code
